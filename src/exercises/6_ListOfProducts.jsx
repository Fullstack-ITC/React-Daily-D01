 * Implement a simple function component that accepts "products" in its props
 * Each product has an id, name and price.
 * The component should render a list of li tags with the products information: "{product.name} {product.price}"
 * If no price is provided for a product (0 is a valid price), present the text "N/A" instead of the price
 * The list should be nested in ul tag
 * Do not forget to add a key to each property (use the id as the key, as it is unique)
